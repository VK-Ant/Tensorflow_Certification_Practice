"""
This script should train a TensorFlow model on the fashion MNIST 
dataset to ~90% test accuracy.

It'll save the model to the current directory using the ".h5" extension.

You can use it to test if your local machine is fast enough to complete the
TensorFlow Developer Certification.

If this script runs in under 5-10 minutes through PyCharm, you're good to go.

The models/datasets in the exam are similar to the ones used in this script.
